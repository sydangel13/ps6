Problem Set 6 


In problem set 5, I used two libraries that do not have an npm (Granim and D3 word cloud library). Because of this, I could only get the moments library to work with wordpack. I worked on this with Shiyu in office hours, which is how I learned these libraries do not have npm/webpack capabilities. The libraries are successfully bundled, but will not appear on the webpage, so I commented out the code so that the page would still run using the moment library.
